                <p className='text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-4 synopsis'>
                  We are introduced to Vikram, a young man who cherishes the
                  happy family photo of himself, his dad, and his loving mother
                  before leaving abroad for college. Despite his deep connection
                  with his mom, Vikram's relationship with his father is distant
                  and formal. The film's theme is subtly stated: "Malli eppudu
                  dorukuthavo ento," reminding us of the uncertainty of life's
                  arrivals. Tragedy strikes when Vikram's beloved mother passes
                  away. It gets worse when Vikram is forced to take a
                  heart-wrenching decision: he tells his father that he can't
                  attend the funeral, causing his father to abruptly hang up on
                  him. Simultaneously, Vikram's personal life is falling apart
                  as he avoids his girlfriend. Desperate for emotional support,
                  he tries reaching out to his dad through video calls, but his
                  father remains closed off. Vikram breaks down while listening
                  to the playlist he made for his mother. He seeks solace in his
                  girlfriend, only to face another blow as she ends their
                  relationship. As Vikram's world crumbles, his father accuses
                  him of being a bad son. After which we discover that the
                  father honors his late wife's memory by making her a cup of
                  coffee whenever he has one. Memories flood back as Vikram
                  watches family videos that his mother sent him and he had
                  ignored, in which his mother points how how her husband loves
                  his son but cannot express it, but rather shows it by checking
                  in on him through his mother. Vikram takes a step towards
                  healing. He makes a cup of coffee and calls her phone. In the
                  emotional climax, Vikram tells his father that they don't need
                  words; he can simply be there for him. Finally, father and son
                  reconcile, bridging the gap that had separated them. In the
                  closing image, the father brings his wife's coffee cup into
                  the frame, completing the picture.

                  Ever since I‚Äôve moved to the US for college 2 years ago, my

                  close with my mother, and if anything happened to her and I
                  wouldn‚Äôt be able to go meet her would be my biggest nightmare.
                  So I‚Äôm trying to play off that emotion, and show how two men
                  who aren‚Äôt used to expressing emotions with each other without
                  their mother around learn to emote and get close again while
                  learning the value of family.
